        <p>
            Hello! My name is Prathik. I’m a data professional, and in my free time, I engage in positional
            trading and occasionally scalp the markets. Over the years, I’ve developed my own algorithms using
            statistical methods, and they’ve proven quite successful in generating profits.
        </p>
        <p>
            I strongly believe in the potential of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for both investing and trading.
            From personal experience, I’ve noticed that ETF trading volume can sometimes reveal market momentum
            or direction. For example, it’s not uncommon to see high trading volumes in specific areas of the
            market. However, the official NSE ETF website typically shows only which AMC’s ETF has high volume,
            not the particular sector or area. When a high-volume pattern persists over several days,
            the stocks within that sector often move significantly—either up or down—reinforcing the volume-based
            observation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, I’m not suggesting that volume analysis alone can predict market movements. It’s simply 
            another tool in our toolbox, offering early signals or guidance—especially when used alongside other
            trading strategies—about which sector stocks might be attracting buyers or sellers.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s why I created tradingtrendz.in. Behind the scenes, I aggregate ETF volume data into sector-focused
            buckets. For instance, all large-cap ETFs from different AMCs are placed under a “large-cap” category, and
            strategy ETFs holding 80 to 90 percent large-cap companies go there as well. Each day, I check which ETFs are trending
            and where volume is surging, helping me identify areas of heavy buying or selling. The longer these volume
            patterns persist, the more meaningful they become. I exclude liquid funds from my analysis because they often
            show volume spikes on Fridays or weekends, as people temporarily park money there, which can skew the overall
            picture compared to equity-based or sectoral ETFs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As new ETFs come to market, they’ll be categorized into the appropriate sector on the site. I’ll update these
            listings whenever I have the time—though it may not be immediate, rest assured I’m keeping an eye on things.
            Until then, any newly launched ETF that hasn’t been categorized yet will appear under its own name in the table,
            so please excuse any temporary placement. My main advice is simple: observe whether certain ETFs maintain high or
            rising volumes over multiple days to see which sectors might be gaining attention. If the volume in a particular
            sector remains consistently high, that could indicate a trend worth exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, always conduct thorough research and testing. Volume trends can be a valuable signal, but they’re never 
            a magic bullet. Wishing you all the best in your trading and investing journey!
