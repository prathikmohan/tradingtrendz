        <p>
            Hello! My name is Prathik Mohan. I’m an engineering professional and currently also pursuing my M.Sc. in Data Science 
            and AI. As a side hobby, I engage in positional trading and occasionally scalp the markets in my free hours. 
            Over time, I developed my own algorithms using statistics, and I've found them to be quite successful 
            in generating profits.
        </p>
        <p>
            I strongly believe in the potential of ETFs/Exchange Traded Funds, both for investing and 
            trading purposes. Through my personal experience, I’ve noticed that the volume of traded ETFs 
            can sometimes give a sense of market momentum or direction. For instance, I once observed 
            unusually high volume in a China ETF on a Monday, and the same pattern continued for the next 
            few days—after which the underlying index went up, essentially validating our volume‑based observation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, I’m not suggesting that mere volume analysis alone is enough to predict the market. 
            It’s more like an additional tool in our toolbox—one that can give us early signals or guidance 
            when combined with other trading strategies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s why I created <strong>tradingtrendz.in</strong>. Behind the scenes, I aggregate ETF volume 
            data and update it regularly. I personally check the site every day to see which ETFs are trending 
            and where volume is surging. The website's backend code runs over 1,600+ lines. One notable exclusion from my table is liquid funds, as their volume 
            often spikes on Fridays or weekends (due to people parking money in them), which can distort 
            the overall volume analysis when compared to equity‑based or sectoral ETFs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Going forward, I aim to include new ETFs as they’re launched by AMCs, though that might take 
            time—so please bear with me. My main advice on how to use this site is simple: 
            observe the consistent or rising volumes over multiple days to get a sense of which sectors 
            might be gaining market attention. If a particular sector's ETF volume stays high consistently, 
            that might indicate a trend worth exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Always remember: do your own thorough research and testing. Volume trends can be a helpful signal, 
            but they’re never a magic bullet. I wish you all the best in your trading and investing journey!
        </p>
